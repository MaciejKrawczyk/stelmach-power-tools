## Technology Stack 🚀

Harnessing the power of modern technology to provide you with a seamless experience:
- **Frontend**: Crafted with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (a React framework) combined with TypeScript for type-safe, efficient, and scalable code.

- **Database Management**: Uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to ensure a robust and optimized database layer.

- **Form Verification**: Integrates [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) with [React Form Hook](https://react-hook-form.com/) to ensure data integrity and user-friendly form interactions.

## Design ✨

Every pixel, every interaction, every animation is meticulously crafted. I've personally designed everything, ensuring not just functionality but also an appealing and intuitive user experience.
